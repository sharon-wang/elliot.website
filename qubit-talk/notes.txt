- every section should be flex with some spans in it
- url should be updated to the hash when scrolling
- there should be a function which tells you the current slide and how scrolled it is so that
    per-slide programmatic animations can be done.

- url updating with hash is a bit annoying: You may not want to go to a specific slide.
